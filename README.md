## SME DFW Chapter Website

This repository contains the source code for the official homepage of the SME
DFW (Dallas-Fort Worth) Chapter found at [smedfw.com](https://www.smedfw.com).

We are an all-volunteer, member-based group which seeks to serve all
engineering/manufacturing students and professionals in the Dallas-Fort Worth
area with value-added events such as factory tours, training events and
collaborative opportunities.

The SME DFW Chapter is a local chapter of SME (formerly the Society of
Manufacturing Engineers). Read more about SME at [sme.org](http://www.sme.org/).
